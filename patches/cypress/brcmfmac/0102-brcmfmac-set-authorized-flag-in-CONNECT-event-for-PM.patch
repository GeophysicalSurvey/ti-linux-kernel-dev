Subject: [PATCH 102/102] brcmfmac: set authorized flag in CONNECT event for
 PMK caching

With 4-way handshake offload for 802.1X authentication, the authorized
flag in CONNECT event should be set for a successful connection with
PMK caching. The connection is identified by checking the existence of
PMKID within the Association Request frame with this patch.
